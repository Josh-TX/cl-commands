## Dummy Action for Debugging
> System Log: Write
This will write to `home-assistant.log`. You can open a shell in the container and run `tail -f home-assistant.log` from the /config directory

This is useful for testing that the trigger+conditions worked. Make sure the action's log level is "warning" or higher.


## getting attributes
```
state_attr('climate.upstairs', 'current_temperature' }}
```

## Condition Last Triggered


```
{{ as_timestamp(now()) - as_timestamp(states.automation.my_automation.attributes.last_triggered) | int > 5 }}
```

```
{{ ( as_timestamp(now()) - as_timestamp(this.attributes.last_triggered) ) > 5 }}
```
but this sometimes works
